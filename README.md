# Form injector
CLI tool that i developed at work to inject forms that was already declared in json file to angular html page which helps to not repeat code and have a more productive work session.

- ask for the path for your components dir
- check if there is a form component and make one if necessarry
- check every html page for a sign of injector
- inject the form with the id given in the injector
- ask for another opeartion
